# Public Health Documents

Curated protocols and structural health references intended for open use—especially in contexts where systemic breakdown, immune drift, or environmental stress affect the body's baseline coherence.

Each document is written to be understandable, implementable, and useful across disciplines—without losing scientific depth.

- [`The GALT Reset Protocol.pdf`](./The%20GALT%20Reset%20Protocol.pdf)  
  *Structured repair framework for gut–immune disintegration. Targets mucosal collapse, microbial loss, food sensitivity cascades, and neuroimmune drift. Grounded in physiological mechanism. Patient-usable, doctor-respectable.*

Dry briefing on GALT structure and its collapse as an immune tolerance training system. Useful to immunologists, pharmacists, functional medics, and clinical generalists tracking systemic drift patterns. Includes Appendex A - Recovery Inputs and System Supports.

- [`GALT and the Loss of Immune Training.pdf`](./GALT%20and%20the%20Loss%20of%20Immune%20Training.pdf)  
- [`GALT and the Loss of Immune Training.docx`](./GALT%20and%20the%20Loss%20of%20Immune%20Training.docx)
