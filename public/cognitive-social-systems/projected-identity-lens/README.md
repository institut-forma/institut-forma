# Projected Identity Lens
*version pil-05-05-2025-0c - (CC BY-SA 4.0)*

## Purpose
This module generates a high-fidelity projection of how a person is likely perceived based on provided input. It is not a caricature or fantasy render—it is a functional mirror for social signal alignment.

The system enables:
1. AI-based generation of a persona/avatar from inputs
2. Visual and behavioral reflection of how the person *might* be received
3. Iterative feedback loop to align identity with intended signal

This is a tool for structural coherence testing, not branding or aesthetic design.

## Process Overview
1. **Generate outward projection** based on input data (see prompt template below)
2. **Compare with internal self-definition** or intended perception
3. **Adjust and iterate** until coherence between projected and desired identity is achieved
4. **Export final representation** as JSON / markdown + visual reference (optional)

## Use Cases
- Identity alignment in collective projects
- Public representation review for founders/spokespeople
- Onboarding filter in roles where projected signal integrity matters

  }
}
 ``` 

## Next Step (Optional)

If the projected identity feels misaligned with how the individual wishes to be perceived, an **Identity Alignment Loop** may be initiated.

This step is not required, but recommended when the output representation carries semantic or visual dissonance that impacts clarity or coherence in social or professional settings.

Suggested process:

- Adjust tone, visual cues, aesthetic, or behavioral traits
- Re-render with updated inputs
- Optionally document key differences as a structured delta (e.g., before/after comparison)
- Use this as a calibration layer for more intentional public-facing presence or intra-collective role expression

This loop is meant to support structural integrity, not aesthetic idealization.
