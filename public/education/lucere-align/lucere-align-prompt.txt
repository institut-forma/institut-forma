I am supporting a student in a special education setting.  
They learn best through individualized structure, physical interaction, and relational safety.

I want to introduce or explore a learning idea — not as abstract content, but as something **experienced, noticed, and made meaningful** by the student.

### The concept I’d like to explore is:
(*Choose or describe one*)

- how something changes when it’s moved, added, or taken away  
- noticing when “more” becomes “less”  
- understanding size through comparison of real objects  
- recognizing a pattern by repeating an action or color sequence  
- using rhythm or light to explore quantity or counting  
- connecting a change in time to a change in activity or state  
- other: [describe your own learning focus]
