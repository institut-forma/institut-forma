**We develop systems that support coherence and maintain integrity.**

These include frameworks such as:

- **forma** — a legal and operational framework for public-impact organizations.  
- **H.I.S.** — a public-sector integrity support for administrative trust and transparency.  
- **lucere** and **lucere align** — a prompt-driven interface for aligning abstract curriculum into cognitively resonant learning sequences.  
- **Coherent Drift** — on the recursive collapse of human identity systems.  
- **GALT and the Loss of Immune Training** — dry briefing on GALT structure and its collapse as an immune tolerance training system.
- **The Unified Substrate Principle** — a phase-coherence foundation for physical reality. Reconstructs major physical laws from substrate-level coherence constraints.

Our work is **open-source** and designed to be held with minimal strain.

**Self-Governance**

The Institute operates under its own **forma framework**, available in both German and English.  
It defines our operational logic, ethical scope, and system design principles.

We apply a transparent **Impact Unit (IU)** model to evaluate real-world effect.  
This measures **observable Impact — not financial growth —** and anchors our work to verifiable outcomes.
